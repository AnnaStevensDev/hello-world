My name is Anna Stevens. I'm 20 years old. My house is in the middle of Diana, Texas where there is not much to do.
I am pursuing computer science as my major, and my hobbies include drawing and playing video games and table-top games.
I have a general appreciation for anything associated with nerd subcultures and have a passion for animated films and series such as Howl's Moving Castle.
